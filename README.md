## Dataset Source
The dataset was publicly released by the Sensing and Control Laboratory at Hangzhou Dianzi University.

## Data Collection

"The urban building rooftop photovoltaic dataset" is a deep learning dataset designed for studying photovoltaic systems installed on rooftops of urban buildings. We employed a Matrice 350 RTK UAV equipped with a Zenmuse H20 infrared imaging camera to capture a total of 1,724 thermographic images on the roofs of three building complexes. The samples encompassed six different classes. The UAV was positioned at a height of 8.5-10 meters above the PV panels at a vertical angle, resulting in clear images with a resolution of 128x200 pixels. The images were captured between 2-5 pm on a sunny day to ensure consistent lighting conditions.
